Q4. Write a short note on tag and element with an example?

Solution:

HTML tags are like keywords which defines that how web browser will format and display the content. With the help of tags, a web browser can distinguish between an HTML content and a simple content. HTML tags contain three main parts: opening tag, content and closing tag. But some HTML tags are unclosed tags.
Examples: <p> </p> 
      <h1></h1> 
       <b></b>

An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag. The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag.
Example: <p> This is an element </p>
